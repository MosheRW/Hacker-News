I would like to know more because i think that this language might be a powerhouse in per se.<p>Since my studies are quite basic in this regards i would like to expand my knowledge on it and kind of specialize myself both in this world and another world (ontologies :D) that i really enjoy.<p>What&#x27;s prolog like in 2024? what are you wonderful people doing with it?<p>thanks from a dumbass :D",overclock351,1721301786,266,160

40987770,Show HN: VisCircuit – A Note-Taking Website for Electronics and Circuits,"Hi, everyone. I created a note-taking website for electronics and circuits where you can draw circuit diagrams and write text notes at the same time.<p>I am a Digital IC designer, and I self-study different types of analog and digital circuits a lot. However, I found a problem. Circuits have many different architectures and are hard to memorize due to numerous experiential tips. I want to document what I learn in my note app, but I found there is no method for me to easily draw circuit and block diagrams alongside text notes.<p>This issue has bothered me for a long time, from my master&#x27;s school to my current working life. I decided to solve it, so I created a note-taking website specifically for electronics and circuits, called VisCircuit.<p>With VisCircuit, you can easily draw circuit diagrams, block diagrams, and write text notes simultaneously. I have already used it for two weeks and have noted down things I find hard to remember, such as SRAM, amplifier circuits, and PCB components of Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I found this tool really useful for memorizing knowledge about electronics and circuits.<p>Currently, I have opened VisCircuit for alpha testing, and I want to let some people use it and give me feedback. Feel free to try it, and I will really appreciate what you think about this project. Leave any suggestions for improvement. Thank you very much.",darrenyaoyaoyao,1721234774,102,20

40991661,Show HN: Llm2sh – Translate plain-language requests into shell commands,"This is my take on the common &quot;use llms to generate shell commands&quot; utility. Emphasis is placed on good CLI UX, simplicity, and flexibility.<p>`llm2sh` supports multiple LLM providers and lets LLMs generate multi-command sequences to handle complex tasks. There is also limited support for commands requiring `sudo` and other basic input.<p>I recommend using Groq llama3-70b for day-to-day use. The ultra-low latency is a game-changer - its near-instant responses helps `llm2sh` integrate seamlessly into day-to-day tasks without breaking you out of the &#x27;zone&#x27;. For more advanced tasks, swapping to smarter models is just a CLI option away.",RandomBK,1721264568,55,20

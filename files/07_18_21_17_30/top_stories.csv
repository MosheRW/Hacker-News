40994552,Ask HN: What's Prolog like in 2024?,"Hi, i am a compsci student that stumbled upon prolog and logic programming during my studies.<p>While i have seen the basics of vanilla prolog (atoms, predicates, cuts, lists and all that jazz) and a godawful implementation of an agent communication system that works on SICStus prolog. I would like to know more because i think that this language might be a powerhouse in per se.<p>Since my studies are quite basic in this regards i would like to expand my knowledge on it and kind of specialize myself both in this world and another world (ontologies :D) that i really enjoy.<p>What&#x27;s prolog like in 2024? what are you wonderful people doing with it?<p>thanks from a dumbass :D",overclock351,1721301786,236,139

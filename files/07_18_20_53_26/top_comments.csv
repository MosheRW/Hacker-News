It would have been more reasonable to confine PROLOG to tasks for which it is well-adapted, e.g., the maintenance of data bases.<p>&gt; On the contrary, attempts were made to improve its efficiency. Thus, as systematic search was too costly, « control » primitives, of the style « don’t try this possibility if... » were introduced.

It aimed to create an &quot;epoch-making computer&quot; with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. FGCS was ahead of its time, and its excessive ambitions led to commercial failure. However, on a theoretical level, the project spurred the development of concurrent logic programming.<p>&gt;The term &quot;fifth generation&quot; was intended to convey the system as being advanced. In the history of computing hardware, there were four &quot;generations&quot; of computers. Computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs to gain performance.<p>[...]<p>&gt;Concurrent logic programming<p>&gt;In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, Ehud Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog, a novel programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a process oriented language, which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms. Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003,[7] which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog. Shapiro&#x27;s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project.[3] It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.<p>&gt;The FGCS project and its findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field.

The project was planned for ten years, but continues through year eleven and beyond. ICOT chose to focus its efforts on language issues and programming methods for logic programming, supported by special hardware. Sequential &#x27;inference machines&#x27; (PSI) and parallel &#x27;inference machines&#x27; (PIM) were built. Performances of the hardware-software hybrid was measured in the range planned (150 million logical inferences per second). An excellent system for logic programming on parallel machines was constructed (XLI). However, applicationswere done in demonstration form only (not deployed). The lack of a stream of applications that computer customers found effective and the sole use of a language outside the mainstream, Prolog, led to disenchantment among the JCMs.<p>Japan&#x27;s Fifth Generation Computer Systems: Success or Failure?<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;comments&#x2F;owb0xg&#x2F;japans_fifth_generation_computer_systems_success&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;comments&#x2F;owb0xg&#x2F;japans_fifth...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instadeq.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;japans-fifth-generation-computer-systems-success-or-failure&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instadeq.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;japans-fifth-generation-comp...</a><p>&gt;This post is a summary of content from papers covering the topic, it&#x27;s mostly quotes from the papers from 1983, 1993 and 1997 with some edition, references to the present and future depend on the paper but should be easy to deduce.

Originally written ii, later ij, and pronounced as a long i (English &quot;ee&quot;), the sound later shifted to be similar to English &quot;eye&quot;, see the Dutch names for the cities Berlijn and Parijs. Meanwhile, the long i sound is now written as ie. IJ is the only Dutch digraph that tends to be treated as a single letter and is capitalized as such. In education in the Netherlands it is taught as the 25th letter instead of y, which does not occur in native Dutch words, and in the phone book it used to be sorted together (mixed) with y.

To avoid typing too much, I&#x27;ll summarize with... bullet points?<p>* The published figure of 10 million people is already outdated. First, they are official figures, which means that they are not telling the truth. Second, six months have elapsed; which means the actual number of residents is less than 9 million.<p>* Not only a large amount of people are gone, but most of them are young, productive people; lots of them professionals in several critical aspects of a functioning society. Where I work I&#x27;m only one of the few that remains in my activity (IT &amp; IT adjacent).<p>* Also gone are many of the more... reactive? brave? People that voiced discontent with the government and just chose to leave. What remains are relatively elderly people that are very conformist, or simple are not brave enough to voice their concerns.<p>* Is Cuba a dictatorship? No.<p>* Is Cuba a totalitarian state? Absolutely. The Cuban Communist Party is the only one allowed, as is written in the (relatively recent) Constitution. Even more than that, it exists above the Constitution, so this texts has no value at all.<p>* Are there human rights violations in Cuba? Yes, no doubt.<p>* Does the US embargo negatively impacts Cuba? Absolutely. Every single day, for the common people, that is. The elites? The top dogs of the Party? Of course they are unaffected; they are your run of the mill corrupt people in power, and they can have anything.<p>* Can Cuba trade with other countries? In theory, yes... in practice, it is very difficult. In addition, Cuba is a minuscule market that interests no one. China, for instance, has very little presence in Cuba, despite we being &quot;allies&quot;.

41020815,,"I am highly skeptical of LLMs as a mechanism to achieve AGI, but I also find this paper fairly unconvincing, bordering on tautological. I feel similarly about this as to what I&#x27;ve read of Chalmers - I agree with pretty much all of the conclusions, but I don&#x27;t feel like the text would convince me of those conclusions if I disagreed; it&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s showing me ways of explaining or illustrating what I already believed.<p>On embodiment - yes, LLMs do not have corporeal experience. But it&#x27;s not obvious that this means that they cannot, a priori, have an &quot;internal&quot; concept of reality, or that it&#x27;s impossible to gain such an understanding from text. The argument feels circular: LLMs are similar to a fake &quot;video game&quot; world because they aren&#x27;t real people - therefore, it&#x27;s wrong to think that they could be real people? And the other half of the argument is that because LLMs can only see text, they&#x27;re missing out on the wider world of non-textual communication; but then, does that mean that human writing is not &quot;real&quot; language? This argument feels especially weak in the face of multi-modal models that are in fact able to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot;.<p>The other flavor of argument here is that LLM behavior is empirically non-human - e.g., the argument about not asking for clarification. But that only means that they aren&#x27;t <i>currently</i> matching humans, not that they <i>couldn&#x27;t</i>.<p>Basically all of these arguments feel like they fall down to the strongest counterargument I see proposed by LLM-believers, which is that sufficiently advanced mimicry is not only indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the limit in fact <i>is</i> the real thing. If we say that it&#x27;s impossible to have true language skills without implicitly having a representation of self and environment, and then we see an entity with what appears to be true language skills, we should conclude that that entity must contain within it a representation of self and environment. That argument doesn&#x27;t rely on any assumptions about the mechanism of representation other than a reliance on physicalism. Looking at it from the other direction, if you assume that all that it means to &quot;be human&quot; is encapsulated in the entropy of a human body, then that concept is necessarily describable with finite entropy. Therefore, by extension, there must be some number of parameters and some model architecture that completely encode that entropy. Questions like whether LLMs are the perfect architecture or whether the number of parameters required is a number that can be practically stored on human-manufacturable media are <i>engineering</i> questions, not philosophical ones: finite problems admit finite solutions, full stop.<p>Again, that conclusion <i>feels</i> wrong to me... but if I&#x27;m being honest with myself, I can&#x27;t point to why, other than to point at some form of dualism or spirituality as the escape hatch.",GeneralMayhem,1721516412,,

This also includes knowing why those concepts are important in the first place, which is often neglected.<p>2. Knowing the meaning of mathematical notation and technical terms, e.g. to be able to read papers in some field. Papers are often full of mathematical and other jargon while otherwise not necessarily being difficult to follow.<p>3. Learning mathematical formulas (e.g. Bayes&#x27; rule) and algorithms (e.g. differentiation), in order to solve specific problems by calculation or computation (mostly in applied mathematics, more rarely in pure mathematics)<p>4. Proving conjectures (mostly in pure mathematics, less often in applied mathematics)<p>5. Learning how to formalize informal problems using mathematical concepts and theories (by applying conceptual understanding gained by 1) in order to understand the problem better, or to make it easier to solve, e.g. by employing calculation (2). (This is often done in engineering and science)<p>Problem sets in textbooks often focus on proofs (4) or some more difficult algorithms (3) but less on the other applications of mathematics.<p>They could also check conceptual understanding (1) by asking the reader to explain some concept in their own terms, or how two different concepts relate to each other, or which concepts various example cases have in common, or how the cases differ on a conceptual level.

To that end, I really like having an constexpr bool operator! instead, so the same checks can be performed without making it easy to accidentally coerce your type into some shady arithmetic operations.

It can also STOP syscalls from working if they are trying to connect out to other nodes and accessing files they shouldn&#x27;t be (using some drunk ass heuristics).<p>What happened here was they pushed a new kernel driver out to every client without authorization to fix an issue with slowness and latency that was in the previous Falcon sensor product. They have a staging system which is supposed to give clients control over this but they pissed over everyone&#x27;s staging and rules and just pushed this to production.<p>This has taken us out and we have 30 people currently doing recovery and DR.

Doing a page fault where you can&#x27;t in the kernel is exactly what I did with my very first patch I submitted after I joined the Microsoft BitLocker team in 2009. I added a check on the driver initialization path and didn&#x27;t annotate the code as non-paged because frankly I didn&#x27;t know at the time that the Windows kernel was paged. All my kernel development experience up to that point was with Linux, which isn&#x27;t paged.<p>BitLocker is a storage driver, so that code turned into a circular dependency. The attempt to page in the code resulted a call to that not-yet-paged-in code.<p>The reason I didn&#x27;t catch it with local testing was because I never tried rebooting with BitLocker enabled on my dev box when I was working on that code. For everyone on the team that did have BitLocker enabled they got the BSOD when they rebooted. Even then the &quot;blast radius&quot; was only the BitLocker team with about 8 devs, since local changes were qualified at the team level before they were merged up the chain.<p>The controls in place not only protected Windows more generally, but they even protected the majority of the Windows development group.

The risk of ZScaler being a central point of failure is not considered. But - the risk of failing the compliance checkbox it satisfies is paramount.<p>All over the place I&#x27;m seeing checkbox compliance being prioritised above actual real risks from how the compliance is implemented.

41012023,,"I think we have reached and inflection point. I mean <i>we have</i> to make an inflection point out of this.-<p>This outage represents more than just a temporary disruption in service; it&#x27;s a black swan célèbre of the perilous state of our current technological landscape. This incident must be seen as an inflection point, a moment where we collectively decide to no longer tolerate the erosion of craftsmanship, excellence, and accountability that I feel we&#x27;ve been seeing all over the place. All over <i>critical</i> places.-<p>Who are we to make this demand? Most likely technologists, managers, specialists, and concerned citizens with the expertise and insight to recognize the dangers inherent in our increasingly careless approach to ... many things, but, particularly technology. Who is to uphold the standards that ensure the safety, reliability, and integrity of the systems that underpin modern life? Government?<p>Historically, the call for accountability and excellence is not new. From Socrates to the industrial revolutions, humanity has periodically grappled with the balance between progress and prudence. People have seen - and complained about - life going to hell, downhill, fast, in a hand basket without brakes since at least Socrates.-<p>Yet, today’s technological failures have unprecedented potential for harm. The Crowdsource outage killed, halted businesses, and posed serious risks to safety—consequences that were almost unthinkable in previous eras. This isn&#x27;t merely a technical failure; it’s a societal one, revealing a disregard for foundational principles of quality and responsibility. Craftsmanship. Care and pride in one&#x27;s work.-<p>Part of the problem lies in the systemic undervaluation of excellence. In pursuit of speed and profit uber alles. Many companies have forsaken rigorous testing, comprehensive risk assessments, and robust security measures. The very basics of engineering discipline—redundancy, fault tolerance, and continuous improvement—are being sacrificed. This negligence is not just unprofessional; it’s dangerous. As this outage has shown, the repercussions are not confined to the digital realm but spill over into the physical world, affecting real lives. As it always has. But never before have the actions of so few &quot;perennial interns&quot; affected so many.-<p>This is a clarion call for all of us with the knowledge and passion to stand up and insist on change. Holding companies accountable, beginning with those directly responsible for the most recent failures.-<p>Yet, it must go beyond punitive measures. We need a cultural shift that re-emphasizes the value of craftsmanship in technology. Educational institutions, professional organizations, and regulatory bodies must collaborate to instill and enforce higher standards. Otherwise, lacking that, we must enforce them ourselves. Even if we only reach ourselves in that commitment.-<p>Perhaps we need more interdisciplinary dialogue. Technological excellence does not exist in a vacuum. It requires input from ethical philosophers, sociologists, legal experts. Anybody willing and able to think these things through.-<p>The ramifications of neglecting these responsibilities are clear and severe. The fallout from technological failures can be catastrophic, extending well beyond financial losses to endanger lives and societal stability. We must therefore approach our work with the gravity it deserves, understanding that excellence is not an optional extra but an essential quality sine qua non in certain fields.-<p>We really need to make this be an actual tuning point, and not just another Wikipedia page.-",Bluestein,1721427752,,

The Portal GUI is basically locking up, so scripting is the only way to do this for thousands of VMs. This command is undocumented and has random combinations of strings as inputs that should be enums. Tab-complete doesn&#x27;t work! See: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powershell&#x2F;module&#x2F;az.compute&#x2F;new-azsnapshotconfig?view=azps-12.0.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;powershell&#x2F;module&#x2F;az.compu...</a><p>E.g.: What are the accepted values for the -CreateOption parameter? Who knows! Good luck using this <i>in a hurry</i>. No stress, just apply it to a production database server at 1 am in the morning.<p>2) There has been a long-standing bug where VMs can&#x27;t have their OS disk swapped out unless the replacement disk matches its properties <i>exactly</i>. For comparison, VMware vSphere has no such restrictions.<p>3) It&#x27;s basically impossible to get to the recovery consoles of VMs, especially VMs stuck in reboot loops. The serial console output is buggy, often filled with gibberish, and doesn&#x27;t scroll back far enough to be useful. Boot diagnostics is an optional feature for &quot;reasons&quot;. Etc..<p>4) It&#x27;s absurdly difficult to get a flat list of all &quot;down&quot; VMs across many subscriptions or resource groups. Again, compare with VMware vSphere where this is trivial.

41022966,,"The moment I read &#x27;it is a <i>content update</i> that causes the BSOD, deleting it solves the problem&#x27;, I was immediately willing to bet a hundred quid (for the non-British, that&#x27;s £100) that it was a combination of said bad binary data and a poorly-written parser that didn&#x27;t error out correctly upon reading invalid data (in this case, read an array of pointers, didn&#x27;t verify that all of them were both non-null and pointed to valid data&#x2F;code).<p>In the past ten years or so of having done somewhat serious computing and zero cybersecurity whatsoever, I have my mind concluded, feel free to disagree.<p>Approximately <i>100%</i> of CVEs, crashes, bugs, slowdowns, and pain points of computing have to do with various forms of deserialising binary data back into machine-readable data structures. All because a) human programmers forget to account for edge cases, and b) imperative programming languages allow us to do so.<p>This includes everything from: decompression algorithms; font outline readers; image, video, and audio parsers; video game data parsers; XML and HTML parsers; the various certificate&#x2F;signature&#x2F;key parsers in OpenSSL (and derivatives); and now, this CrowdStrike content parser in its EDR program.<p>That wager stands, by the way, and I&#x27;m happy to up the ante by £50 to account for my second theory.",delta_p_delta_x,1721543911,,
41023440,,"I see a paradox that the null bytes are &quot;not related&quot; to the current situation and yet deleting the file seems to cure the issue. Perhaps the CS official statement that &quot;This is not related to null bytes contained within Channel File 291 or any other Channel File.&quot; is poorly worded.<p>My opinion is that CS is trying to say the null bytes themselves aren&#x27;t the actual root cause of the issue, but merely a trigger for the actual root cause, which is that CSAgent.sys has a problem where malformed input vectors can cause it to crash. Well designed programs should error out gracefully for foreseeable errors, like corrupted config files.<p>If we interpret that quoted sentence such that &quot;this&quot; is referring to &quot;the logical error&quot;, and that &quot;the logical error&quot; is the error in CSAgent.sys that causes it to crash upon reading a bad channel file, then that statement makes sense.<p>This is a bit of a stretch, but so far my impression with CS corporate communication regarding this issue has been nothing but abject chaos, so this is totally on-brand for them.",hatsunearu,1721550399,,
41022728,,By-passing the discussion whether one actually needs root kit powered endpoint surveillance software such as CS perhaps an open-source solution would be a killer to move this whole sector to more ethical standards.

On the other hand it could still be a business model to supply malware signatures as a security team feeding this system.,G3rn0ti,1721541040,,

Second, six months have elapsed; which means the actual number of residents is less than 9 million.<p>* Not only a large amount of people are gone, but most of them are young, productive people; lots of them professionals in several critical aspects of a functioning society.

Absolutely. The Cuban Communist Party is the only one allowed, as is written in the (relatively recent) Constitution. Even more than that, it exists above the Constitution, so this texts has no value at all.<p>* Are there human rights violations in Cuba? Yes, no doubt.<p>* Does the US embargo negatively impacts Cuba? Absolutely. Every single day, for the common people, that is. The elites? The top dogs of the Party? Of course they are unaffected; they are your run of the mill corrupt people in power, and they can have anything.<p>* Can Cuba trade with other countries?

Moreover, emigration provides an escape for those people who might otherwise form a potentially powerful class of under-employed and politically discontent civilians. If Cuba’s emigrants were still living on the island, then the Communist regime would have good reason to worry about a mass revolution, as shown by the experience of the Arab Spring, when authoritarian governments in Syria, Libya and Egypt, each struggling with rising demographic pressures and economic stagnation, were destabilized by popular rebellion.

I feel similarly about this as to what I&#x27;ve read of Chalmers - I agree with pretty much all of the conclusions, but I don&#x27;t feel like the text would convince me of those conclusions if I disagreed; it&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s showing me ways of explaining or illustrating what I already believed.<p>On embodiment - yes, LLMs do not have corporeal experience. But it&#x27;s not obvious that this means that they cannot, a priori, have an &quot;internal&quot; concept of reality, or that it&#x27;s impossible to gain such an understanding from text. The argument feels circular: LLMs are similar to a fake &quot;video game&quot; world because they aren&#x27;t real people - therefore, it&#x27;s wrong to think that they could be real people? And the other half of the argument is that because LLMs can only see text, they&#x27;re missing out on the wider world of non-textual communication; but then, does that mean that human writing is not &quot;real&quot; language? This argument feels especially weak in the face of multi-modal models that are in fact able to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot;.<p>The other flavor of argument here is that LLM behavior is empirically non-human - e.g., the argument about not asking for clarification. But that only means that they aren&#x27;t <i>currently</i> matching humans, not that they <i>couldn&#x27;t</i>.<p>Basically all of these arguments feel like they fall down to the strongest counterargument I see proposed by LLM-believers, which is that sufficiently advanced mimicry is not only indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the limit in fact <i>is</i> the real thing. If we say that it&#x27;s impossible to have true language skills without implicitly having a representation of self and environment, and then we see an entity with what appears to be true language skills, we should conclude that that entity must contain within it a representation of self and environment. That argument doesn&#x27;t rely on any assumptions about the mechanism of representation other than a reliance on physicalism. Looking at it from the other direction, if you assume that all that it means to &quot;be human&quot; is encapsulated in the entropy of a human body, then that concept is necessarily describable with finite entropy. Therefore, by extension, there must be some number of parameters and some model architecture that completely encode that entropy. Questions like whether LLMs are the perfect architecture or whether the number of parameters required is a number that can be practically stored on human-manufacturable media are <i>engineering</i> questions, not philosophical ones: finite problems admit finite solutions, full stop.<p>Again, that conclusion <i>feels</i> wrong to me... but if I&#x27;m being honest with myself, I can&#x27;t point to why, other than to point at some form of dualism or spirituality as the escape hatch.",GeneralMayhem,1721516412,,

I know that neural nets, and the mechanisms LLMs employ to train and form relational connections, can plausibly be compared to how synapses form signal paths between neurons. I can see how that makes intuitive sense.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to articulate my cognitive dissonance here, but is there any empirical evidence that LLMs, or their underlying machine learning technology, share anything at all with biological consciousness beyond a convenient metaphor for describing &quot;neural networks&quot; using terms borrowed from neuroscience? I don&#x27;t know that it necessarily follows that just because something was inspired by, or is somehow mimicking, the structure of the brain and its basic elements, that it should necessarily relate to its modeled reality in any literal way, let alone provide a sufficient basis for instantiating a phenomena we frankly know very little about. Not for nothing, but our models naturally cannot replicate any biological functions we do not fully understand. We haven&#x27;t managed to reproduce biological tissues that are exponentially less complex than the brain, are we really claiming that we&#x27;re just jumping straight past lab-grown t-bones to intelligent minds?<p>I&#x27;m sure most of the people reading this will have seen Matt Parker&#x27;s videos where they &quot;teach&quot; matchbooks to win a game against humans. Is anyone suggesting those matchbooks, given infinite time and repetition, would eventually spark emergent consciousness?<p>&gt; The argument would be that that conceptual model is encoded in the intermediate-layer parameters of the model, in a different but analogous way to how it&#x27;s encoded in the graph and chemical structure of your neurons.<p>Sorry if I have misinterpreted anyone. I honestly thought all the &quot;neuron&quot; and &quot;synapse&quot; references were handy metaphors to explain otherwise complex computations that resemble this conceptual idea of how our brains work.

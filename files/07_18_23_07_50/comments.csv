It was a partial and insecure monopoly; they did need to innovate or they would eventually be eaten.  Telecoms was their business, in the very broadest sense.  New ways of drawing wire more efficiently would benefit their bottom line.  New forms of amplifier technology would almost certainly benefit them ten or twenty years down the line.  Same with a new kind of treatment to make telephone poles last longer.  So basic metallurgy, forestry, and cutting-edge semiconductor physics were all within the remit.

Sure, the fact that each emitter can be tuned to &quot;any colour&quot; might be misleading, but even if you use rapid dithering like plasma displays did, and pin each emitter to one wavelength, you suddenly have a valid path to manufacturing insanely high density microLED displays!

We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don’t become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.”

It aimed to create an &quot;epoch-making computer&quot; with supercomputer-like performance and to provide a platform for future developments in artificial intelligence. FGCS was ahead of its time, and its excessive ambitions led to commercial failure. However, on a theoretical level, the project spurred the development of concurrent logic programming.<p>&gt;The term &quot;fifth generation&quot; was intended to convey the system as being advanced. In the history of computing hardware, there were four &quot;generations&quot; of computers. Computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs to gain performance.<p>[...]<p>&gt;Concurrent logic programming<p>&gt;In 1982, during a visit to the ICOT, Ehud Shapiro invented Concurrent Prolog, a novel programming language that integrated logic programming and concurrent programming. Concurrent Prolog is a process oriented language, which embodies dataflow synchronization and guarded-command indeterminacy as its basic control mechanisms. Shapiro described the language in a Report marked as ICOT Technical Report 003,[7] which presented a Concurrent Prolog interpreter written in Prolog. Shapiro&#x27;s work on Concurrent Prolog inspired a change in the direction of the FGCS from focusing on parallel implementation of Prolog to the focus on concurrent logic programming as the software foundation for the project.[3] It also inspired the concurrent logic programming language Guarded Horn Clauses (GHC) by Ueda, which was the basis of KL1, the programming language that was finally designed and implemented by the FGCS project as its core programming language.<p>&gt;The FGCS project and its findings contributed greatly to the development of the concurrent logic programming field.

The project was carried out by a central research institute, ICOT, with personnel from its member-owners, the Japanese computer manufacturers (JCMs) and other electronics industry firms. The project was planned for ten years, but continues through year eleven and beyond. ICOT chose to focus its efforts on language issues and programming methods for logic programming, supported by special hardware. Sequential &#x27;inference machines&#x27; (PSI) and parallel &#x27;inference machines&#x27; (PIM) were built. Performances of the hardware-software hybrid was measured in the range planned (150 million logical inferences per second). An excellent system for logic programming on parallel machines was constructed (XLI). However, applicationswere done in demonstration form only (not deployed). The lack of a stream of applications that computer customers found effective and the sole use of a language outside the mainstream, Prolog, led to disenchantment among the JCMs.<p>Japan&#x27;s Fifth Generation Computer Systems: Success or Failure?<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;comments&#x2F;owb0xg&#x2F;japans_fifth_generation_computer_systems_success&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;prolog&#x2F;comments&#x2F;owb0xg&#x2F;japans_fifth...</a><p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instadeq.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;japans-fifth-generation-computer-systems-success-or-failure&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instadeq.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;posts&#x2F;japans-fifth-generation-comp...</a><p>&gt;This post is a summary of content from papers covering the topic, it&#x27;s mostly quotes from the papers from 1983, 1993 and 1997 with some edition, references to the present and future depend on the paper but should be easy to deduce.

I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of value out of chat gpt 4o, like lots of other people. I find with each model generation my dependence on this stuff for day to day work goes up as the soundness of its answers and reasoning improve.<p>There are still lots of issues and limitations but it&#x27;s a very different experience than with gpt 3 early on. A lot of the smaller OSS models are a bit of a mixed bag in terms of hallucinations and utility. But they can be useful if you apply some skills. Half the success is actually learning to prompt these things and learning to spot when it starts to hallucinate.<p>One thing I find useful is to run ideas by it in kind of a socratic mode where I try to get it to flesh out brain farts I have for algorithms or other kinds of things. This can be coding related topics but also non technical kinds of things. It will get some things wrong and when you spot it, you can often get a better answer simply by pointing it out and maybe nudging it in a different direction. A useful trick with code is to also let it generate tests for its own code. When the tests fail to run, you can ask it to fix it. Or you can ask it for some alternative implementation of the same thing. Often you get something that is 95% close to what you asked for and then you can just do the remaining few percent yourself.<p>Doing TDD with an LLM is a power move. Good tests are easy enough to understand and once they pass, it&#x27;s hard to argue with the results. And you can just ask it to identify edge cases and add more tests for those. LLMs take a lot of the tediousness out of writing tests. I&#x27;m a big picture kind of guy and my weakness is skipping unit tests to fast forward to having working code. 
Spelling out all the stupid little assertions is mindnumbingly stupid work that I don&#x27;t have to bother with anymore. I just let AI generate good test cases. LLMs make TDD a lot less tedious. It&#x27;s like having a really diligent junior pair programmer doing all the easy bits.<p>And if you apply SOLID principles to your own code (which is a good thing in any case), a lot of code is self contained enough that you can easily fit it in a small file that is small enough to fit into the context window of chat gpt (which is quite large these days). So, a thing I often do is just gather relevant code, copy past it and then tell it to make some reasonable assumptions about missing things and make some modifications to the code. Add a function that does X; how would I need to modify this code to address Y; etc. I also get it to iterate on its own code. And a neat trick is to ask it to compare its solution to other solutions out there and then get it to apply some of the same principles and optimizations.<p>One thing with RAG is that we&#x27;re still under utilizing LLMs for this. It&#x27;s a lot easier to get an LLM to ask good questions than it is to get them to provide the right answers. With RAG, you can use good old information retrieval to answer the questions. IMHO limiting RAG to just vector search is a big mistake. It actually doesn&#x27;t work that well for structured data and you could just ask it to query some API based on a specification of use some sql, xpath, or whatever query language. And why just ask 1 question? Maybe engage in a dialog where it zooms in on the solution via querying and iteratively coming up with better questions until the context has all the data needed to come up with the answer.<p>If you think about it, this is how most knowledge workers address problems themselves. They are not oracles of wisdom that know everything but merely aggregators and filters of external knowledge. A good knowledge worker &#x2F; researcher &#x2F; engineer is one that knows how to ask the right questions in order to come up with an iterative process that converges on a solution.<p>Once you stop using LLMs as one shot oracles that give you an answer given a question, they become a lot more useful.<p>As for AGI, a human AI enhanced by AGI is a powerful combination.

—<p>on: One year of using an Apple Watch Ultra as a phone ...<p>I have done this as well, but with series 4. Some notes:<p>- Apple Watch receives calls forwarded from your phone which creates a bunch of weird problems: 1) Imagine you’re at a bar and get a phone call. You need to either answer on your watch immediately on speakerphone which means its hard to hear the caller and hard for them to hear you, and your conversation is not private. Or, dismiss the call, go outside, put your airpods in, hope they connect, call back, hope they answer, and hope the traffic isnt too bad around you because airpods do not have best mics. 2) connecting airpods really suck, especially at home. You have to have your phone in the charger for it to forward calls to your watch, so when you put on your airpods, they will likely connect to your phone, so you run to your phone, then your airpods “magically” connect to your watch all the while your caller is shouting “hello” into the void. Not ideal for work calls.<p>- I really hated not having a notes.app<p>- messages are kinda bad, especially if you’re non-english. And again, if you’re out at a bar and meeting someone, you cant really wait to get home to message back, you have to noodle around on the small screen.<p>- Your friends will tease you. I didnt mind, but its good to be prepared.<p>- its a teeny bit annoying wearing a tech-watch. Can get a bit hot etc.<p>- You need an iphone to update the watch. This really suck because you never really feel you actually let go of your phone, its a hassle updating over bluetooth, installing apps etc. I would LOVE an ipad&#x2F;mac watch.app.<p>- You need Siri for many things, like maps.app, searching for certain things etc. It really sucks, like, completely unusable.<p>- doesnt work well switching from wifi to celluar.

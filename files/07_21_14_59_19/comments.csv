Meanwhile, the long i sound is now written as ie. IJ is the only Dutch digraph that tends to be treated as a single letter and is capitalized as such. In education in the Netherlands it is taught as the 25th letter instead of y, which does not occur in native Dutch words, and in the phone book it used to be sorted together (mixed) with y.

First, they are official figures, which means that they are not telling the truth. Second, six months have elapsed; which means the actual number of residents is less than 9 million.<p>* Not only a large amount of people are gone, but most of them are young, productive people; lots of them professionals in several critical aspects of a functioning society. Where I work I&#x27;m only one of the few that remains in my activity (IT &amp; IT adjacent).<p>* Also gone are many of the more... reactive? brave? People that voiced discontent with the government and just chose to leave. What remains are relatively elderly people that are very conformist, or simple are not brave enough to voice their concerns.<p>* Is Cuba a dictatorship? No.<p>* Is Cuba a totalitarian state? Absolutely. The Cuban Communist Party is the only one allowed, as is written in the (relatively recent) Constitution. Even more than that, it exists above the Constitution, so this texts has no value at all.<p>* Are there human rights violations in Cuba? Yes, no doubt.<p>* Does the US embargo negatively impacts Cuba? Absolutely. Every single day, for the common people, that is. The elites? The top dogs of the Party? Of course they are unaffected; they are your run of the mill corrupt people in power, and they can have anything.<p>* Can Cuba trade with other countries? In theory, yes... in practice, it is very difficult. In addition, Cuba is a minuscule market that interests no one. China, for instance, has very little presence in Cuba, despite we being &quot;allies&quot;.

41020815,,"I am highly skeptical of LLMs as a mechanism to achieve AGI, but I also find this paper fairly unconvincing, bordering on tautological. I feel similarly about this as to what I&#x27;ve read of Chalmers - I agree with pretty much all of the conclusions, but I don&#x27;t feel like the text would convince me of those conclusions if I disagreed; it&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s showing me ways of explaining or illustrating what I already believed.<p>On embodiment - yes, LLMs do not have corporeal experience. But it&#x27;s not obvious that this means that they cannot, a priori, have an &quot;internal&quot; concept of reality, or that it&#x27;s impossible to gain such an understanding from text. The argument feels circular: LLMs are similar to a fake &quot;video game&quot; world because they aren&#x27;t real people - therefore, it&#x27;s wrong to think that they could be real people? And the other half of the argument is that because LLMs can only see text, they&#x27;re missing out on the wider world of non-textual communication; but then, does that mean that human writing is not &quot;real&quot; language? This argument feels especially weak in the face of multi-modal models that are in fact able to &quot;see&quot; and &quot;hear&quot;.<p>The other flavor of argument here is that LLM behavior is empirically non-human - e.g., the argument about not asking for clarification. But that only means that they aren&#x27;t <i>currently</i> matching humans, not that they <i>couldn&#x27;t</i>.<p>Basically all of these arguments feel like they fall down to the strongest counterargument I see proposed by LLM-believers, which is that sufficiently advanced mimicry is not only indistinguishable from the real thing, but at the limit in fact <i>is</i> the real thing. If we say that it&#x27;s impossible to have true language skills without implicitly having a representation of self and environment, and then we see an entity with what appears to be true language skills, we should conclude that that entity must contain within it a representation of self and environment. That argument doesn&#x27;t rely on any assumptions about the mechanism of representation other than a reliance on physicalism. Looking at it from the other direction, if you assume that all that it means to &quot;be human&quot; is encapsulated in the entropy of a human body, then that concept is necessarily describable with finite entropy. Therefore, by extension, there must be some number of parameters and some model architecture that completely encode that entropy. Questions like whether LLMs are the perfect architecture or whether the number of parameters required is a number that can be practically stored on human-manufacturable media are <i>engineering</i> questions, not philosophical ones: finite problems admit finite solutions, full stop.<p>Again, that conclusion <i>feels</i> wrong to me... but if I&#x27;m being honest with myself, I can&#x27;t point to why, other than to point at some form of dualism or spirituality as the escape hatch.",GeneralMayhem,1721516412,,

I know that neural nets, and the mechanisms LLMs employ to train and form relational connections, can plausibly be compared to how synapses form signal paths between neurons. I can see how that makes intuitive sense.<p>I&#x27;m struggling to articulate my cognitive dissonance here, but is there any empirical evidence that LLMs, or their underlying machine learning technology, share anything at all with biological consciousness beyond a convenient metaphor for describing &quot;neural networks&quot; using terms borrowed from neuroscience? I don&#x27;t know that it necessarily follows that just because something was inspired by, or is somehow mimicking, the structure of the brain and its basic elements, that it should necessarily relate to its modeled reality in any literal way, let alone provide a sufficient basis for instantiating a phenomena we frankly know very little about. Not for nothing, but our models naturally cannot replicate any biological functions we do not fully understand. We haven&#x27;t managed to reproduce biological tissues that are exponentially less complex than the brain, are we really claiming that we&#x27;re just jumping straight past lab-grown t-bones to intelligent minds?<p>I&#x27;m sure most of the people reading this will have seen Matt Parker&#x27;s videos where they &quot;teach&quot; matchbooks to win a game against humans. Is anyone suggesting those matchbooks, given infinite time and repetition, would eventually spark emergent consciousness?<p>&gt; The argument would be that that conceptual model is encoded in the intermediate-layer parameters of the model, in a different but analogous way to how it&#x27;s encoded in the graph and chemical structure of your neurons.<p>Sorry if I have misinterpreted anyone. I honestly thought all the &quot;neuron&quot; and &quot;synapse&quot; references were handy metaphors to explain otherwise complex computations that resemble this conceptual idea of how our brains work. But it reads a lot like some of the folks in this thread believe it&#x27;s much more than metaphors, but rather a literal analog.",nativeit,1721528428,,
